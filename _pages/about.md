Hello! My name is Kexin Zheng, and I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC). My research interest lie broadly in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence with a focus on Optimization and Constraint Reasoning. I am especially interested in designing efficient FastMap-based algorithms for solving combinatorial problems in Artificial Intelligence. I aim to support decision-making in the real world in the presence of constraint reasoning. I am fortunate to be part of the CATAI lab and to be advised by [Prof. Satish Kumar Thittamaranahalli](https://www.tkskwork.org/). Besides, I collaborated closely with Prof. Rajiv Kalia on generative AI projects.

I earned my B.E. in Environmental Engineering at Beijing University of Technology, supervised by Prof. Li Zhang, and my M.S. in Applied Data Science at USC, supervised by Prof. Satish.
